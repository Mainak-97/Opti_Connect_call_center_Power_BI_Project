1. Total calls-  count of call id (card)  OR  dax measure-   Total calls = count(Sheet1[Call Id])
2. Average speed of answer-
dax masure- Avg speed ans = calculate(average(Sheet1[Speed of Answer]),Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]="Y")
3. Abondoned Calls-
dax measure- Abondoned calls = Calculate(countrows('Sheet1'),'Sheet1'[Answered (Y/N)]="N")
4. Overall Satisfaction-
dax measure-  Overall satisfaction = calculate(average(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]),'Sheet1'[Satisfaction rating] <> 0)
5. Total answered calls-
dax measure -   Total answered calls = calculate(countrows('Sheet1'),'Sheet1'[Answered (Y/N)]="Y")
6. Abondoned rate-
dax measure-   Abondoned rate = divide([Abondoned calls],[Total calls])
then format it to %
7. Satisfaction <= 3 (donot count 0)
dax measure-  Stsfcn lessequal to 3 = calculate(COUNTROWS('Sheet1'),Sheet1[Satisfaction rating] <=3, 'Sheet1'[Satisfaction rating] <>0)
8.
